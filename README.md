This is a full stack Yahtzee-clone application.  The front end was bootstrapped with Create React App using Redux for state management.  The backend was created with Express and Mongodb/Mongoose to let the user save their score and have it displayed on the highscores page.

This was a challenging project in logic, so I tackled it in small pieces by first developing the dice system, and then creating the component for the scorecard sections.  SessionStorage is used to save the game state.  All design work was done by myself using CSS / media-queries.
